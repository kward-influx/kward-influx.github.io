# PoC for Discourse Community -> Coveo Integration

index.html is the Coveo results page, this is what needs to be hosted somewhere. It is a single file with all things embedded (including header logo).

discourse.html is what would need to be disected and used on the Community Discourse site.

This currently works as a header element in Discourse at: https://jury.trydiscourse.com/

It will probably need to be massaged to work elsewhere within the layout (outside of header)
